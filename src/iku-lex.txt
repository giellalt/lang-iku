%TRUNC !truncation dummy
%CVCTRUNC !dummy for very long truncations
%VCTRUNC !dummy for long truncation
%FRIC !dummy for fricativizing stem-final consonants. Needed to avoid a general rule that also would affect unwantedly as in *aaġagu for aaqagu. The alternative would have been to postulate truncating flexives with a fricative first consonant (*aiviq -q +ġit) but that is hokus pokus
%EBLOCK !dummy to block schwa going to a (aŋutik not *aŋuttak)
%C ! dummy for intermediate gemination
%DEFRIC !dummy when fricatives go stops (amaġuq -> amaqquk) as apposed to %C in niġi+VIK -> niġġivik
%SCHWADEL !dummy with derivatives truncating semi-final schwa
!%CLIT !dummy with clitics used in Kalaallisut. This far unused in iku

! This file gives the start and end of the Iñupiaq lexicon. 
! The lexicon Root points at the different parts of speech.
! Each POS has its own file noun-iku-lex.txt, etc., which in
! turn points to noun-iku-morph.txt, etc.
! POS-changing nominalizers are found in verb-iku-morph.txt and verbalizers in noun-iku-morph.txt
! It might be a good idea to have noun-iku-der.txt etc. as well.
! The common, final lexica, are found in this file.

!About lexica and continuations. Instead of separate lexica for words that can only be sing or only plur and others for words that can take all numbers, this is a better solution: Normal nouns are tagged tp, tup etc. whereas specials are tagged with the continuation lexicon
